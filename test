;;;- There now follow some examples

;;;- => (a.b)
(a.b)

;;;- => ((a b c) . d)
(a b c . d)

;;;- (a.b c d) => Misplaced .
(a.b c d)

;;;- result: from (a b . c d) is Misplaced .
(a b . c d)

;;;- => (a . ((b c d) . e))

;;;- The list (this is -foo closed) =>

;;;- an over closed list (this is over closed)) =>  unexpected )

;;;- and finally: an unclosed list at eof: erroneous
